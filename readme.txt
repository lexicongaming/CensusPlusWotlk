CensusPlusTBC

This is an interface addon for World of Warcraft: TBC which records details about characters currently online in your faction at the time of the polling. This is done with liberal use of the in-game /who command via the Wholib. The information is then stored in the CensusPlusTBC.lua in your account's SavedVariables folder, which could be uploaded to WoWClassicPop.com (made by Scarecr0w12)

These instructions will explain you how to install the addon.

Installing the addon

- Use an unzipping program like 7zip and extract the CensusPlusTBC folder to your addons directory
- The addon directory is usually located here:
-- `..\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface`
- When you log into the game the CensusPlusTBC addon automatically starts collecting data. You can watch the progress through the minimap icon.
- After the census is taken you get a message in chat how many characters were recorded
- Logout or do a /reload to force the addon to write its data into the *.lua file
- Navigate to `..\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\WTF\Account\1234567#1\SavedVariables\` and find the CensusPlusTBC.lua (1234567#1 is a different number for you or your account name)
